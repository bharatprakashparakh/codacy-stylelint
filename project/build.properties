# Comments with excessive length, making them harder to read and maintain
# This is a very long comment that goes on and on without any real need for it to be this long,
# but it is here to demonstrate the kind of code smell that can occur when comments are not concise
# and to the point, making it harder for developers to quickly understand the context or purpose
# of the property or configuration being described.
